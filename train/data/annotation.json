Since then I’ve become a strong Senior Developer and Leader.  I’ve created  hundreds of applications, worked with small businesses to Fortune 500 corporations, built teams where groups once existed – ultimately becoming a passionate and self-motivated  developer. I enjoy team environments that feed off each other’s passion for what they do; who seek  performance and optimization over what’s easy or quick.   I believe that this is the  environment for which success is brewed, and results are delivered. So, are you looking for a strong WORDPRESS developer who takes development  seriously, is willing to lead\/mentor others and still maintain a good sense of humor?  If  so, give me the message and let’s talk!
